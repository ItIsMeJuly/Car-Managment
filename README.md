# Thread-Safe-Structures
This repository holds two types of data structures in C++ with thread-safe implementation:
<ol>
  <li>Blocking Structures - using mutexes, lock guards and conditional variables</li>
  <li>Lock-free Structures - using atomic data types for synchronisation</li>
</ol>
<br>
A testing cpp file is present where the structures are tested with reads and writes from different threads.
